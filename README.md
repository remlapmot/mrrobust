## Latest updates

To obtain the latest update please see instructions [below](#installing-and-updating-mrrobust).

* February 2022:
  - Ran cscripts under Stata 17.0
  - Updated website examples to run under Stata 17.0
* September 2021:
  - Changed relevant `http:` URLs to `https:`
  - Minor edits to the helpfiles
* June 2021:
  - Published an interactive Code Ocean capsule demonstrating the use of the mrrobust package 
  [here](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.0587524.v1)
  - By default `mrforest` now specifies a fixed effect standard error for its IVW estimate 
* April 2021:
  - Added the I-squared statistic and its 95% CI to the `mregger ..., heterogi` output
* February 2021:
  - Fixes to `mrforest` and `mrleaveoneout` related to the recent update to `metan`. 
  `mrforest` and `mrleaveoneout` now use `metan9` instead of `metan` because of the changes to 
  `metan` syntax. No change was necessary in the dependency scripts because `metan9` is also 
  installed with `ssc install metan`
  - Checked cscripts pass
  - Checked examples on website run. And changed the 2 examples which use TwoSampleMR to use 
  the new ID code for the exposure data
  - Updated `dependency.do` to make it more robust to the more frequent updates to `metan`
  - Updated `mrdeps` to make it more robust to the more frequent updates to `metan`
* October 2020:
  - `dependency.do` and `mrdeps` now install the updated version of the `moremata` package
  - Checked the cscripts run under Stata 16.1
  - Added description of Q-statistic as Cochran's and Ruecker's for the IVW and MR-Egger models 
  respectively
  - In various helpfiles added clarification that genotype-disease stands for SNP-outcome 
  (or indeed instrument-outcome) and that genotype-phenotype stands for SNP-exposure (or indeed 
  instrument-exposure) respectively; i.e. the estimates required for the top and bottom of the IV 
  Wald ratio estimate
* August 2020:
  - Added html versions of the helpfiles to the website. These are available from the website 
  menu bar or [here](https://remlapmot.github.io/mrrobust/docs/helpfiles/)
  - Added extra decimal places examples to helpfiles of `mrforest` and `mrleaveoneout`
  - `mrfunnel` now includes a legend on its plot
* July 2020:
  - Added `gxse()` option to `mrmvivw` to return instrument strength Q<sub>A</sub> statistic for 
  instrument validity in `e(Qa)` ([Sanderson et al. 2019](#references))
  - The `gxse()` option additionally returns the Q<sub>x</sub> and conditional F-statistics for 
  each phenotype for instrument strength in `e(Qx)` and `e(Fx)` 
  ([Sanderson et al. 2020](#references))
  - Added `tdist` option to `mrmvivw` and `mrmvegger`
  - `mrmvivw` and `mrmvegger` now ereturn the RMSE in `e(phi)`
  - `mregger, ivw` now displays the square root of the residual variance (residual standard error) 
  and ereturns this is `e(phi)`
  - Checked that examples on website still run
  - Added `mrleaveoneout` command to perform leave one out analysis
* June 2020:
  - Simplified the outcome variable name in `mregger` b and V e-returned matrices. Turn this off 
  with new `oldnames` option
  - Added basic multivariable MR-Egger command, `mrmvegger`
  - Added basic multivariable IVW command, `mrmvivw` (currently command names `mvmr` and `mvivw` 
  also work)
* February 2020:
  - Updated contact details
  - Minor edits to helpfiles, to show examples setting `seed()` option where helpful
  - Fixed `mregger` bug where `r(table)` was not returned with the `gxse` or `heterogi` options. 
  The output for these options now appears before the coefficient table.
  - Minor amendments to formatting of `mregger` `gxse` output
  - `mregger` now ereturns `e(phi)`, the scale parameter, in some cases
* January 2020:
  - `mregger` now additionally returns `r(table)`
  - Certification scripts: added `master.do` and renamed and edited a few scripts
  - Added `mr` command. Commands may now be run as either `mr egger ...` or as previously 
  `mregger ...`.
  - [*Best of IJE 2019*!](https://academic.oup.com/ije/pages/the_best_of_ije)
  - `mrmedian`, `mrmedianobs`, `mreggersimex`, `mrmodal`, and `mrratio` now additionally return 
  the `r(table)` matrix (the information from the coefficient table)
  - Added an example showing how you can save and export your estimates using `r(table)`, see 
  [here](https://remlapmot.github.io/mrrobust/docs/save-estimates)
* December 2019:
  - Added `Q_GX` to ereturn and display output when `gxse()` option specified to `mregger`
  - Changed `Q_GX` and `I^2_GX` output to use first order weights in `mregger` output. This matches 
  the output from the `mr_egger()` function in the `MendelianRandomization` R package. Use the 
  `unwi2gx` option to report the unweighted statistics.
* July 2019:
  - Checked that examples on website still run
* December 2018: 
  - Improved compatibility with the [`github` package](https://haghish.github.io/github/), i.e. 
  mrrobust and its dependencies can be installed simply by issuing: `gitget mrrobust` , assuming 
  that you have the `github` package installed. 
  [See below for instructions](#2-use-the-github-package).
  - `mrdeps` command added for conveniently installing dependencies
* November 2018:
  - Example showing the use of `TwoSampleMR` and `mrrobust` in the same 
  [R Markdown script](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (`.Rmd` file) is 
  [here](https://remlapmot.github.io/mrrobust/docs/rmarkdown-call-stata-example)
  - Example showing the use of `TwoSampleMR` and `mrrobust` in the same 
  [Stata Markdown](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown) script (`.stmd` file) is

## Helpfile examples
Click [here](https://remlapmot.github.io/mrrobust/docs/mrrobust-examples) for some of the code and 
output from the examples in the helpfiles.

Once the package is installed, there is a summary helpfile which can be viewed in Stata with:
```stata
help mrrobust
```
This has links to the helpfile for each command, which has an example near the bottom. In these 
examples you can click on the code to run it.

## Overview
The mrrobust package is a collection of commands for performing two-sample Mendelian randomization 
analyses using summary data of genotype-phenotype and genotype-outcome associations. 

Such data can be obtained from repositories such as MR-Base <https://www.mrbase.org> 
([Hemani et al. 2016](#references)).

The package contains the following commands:

 - `mrdeps` installs dependencies for the package
 - `mrratio` implements the standard instrumental variable ratio (Wald) estimate with a choice of 
 standard errors/confidence intervals
 - `mrivests` automates calling `mrratio` on all the selected genotypes in your dataset
 - `mregger` implements the IVW and MR-Egger regression approaches introduced in 
 [Bowden et al. (2015)](#references)
 - `mreggersimex` implements the simulation extrapolation algorithm for the MR-Egger model
 - `mreggerplot` implements a scatter plot with fitted line (either from IVW, MR-Egger, or weighted 
 median estimators) and confidence interval
 - `mrmedian` and `mrmedianobs` implement the unweighted, weighted, and penalized weighted median 
 IV estimators robust to 50% invalid instruments in [Bowden et al. (2016)](#references)
 - `mrmodal` implements the zero modal estimator of [Hartwig et al. (2017)](#references)
 - `mrmodalplot` plot of density used in modal estimator
 - `mrforest` implements a forest plot of genotype specific IV estimates and estimates from models 
 (e.g. IVW and MR-Egger)
 - `mrfunnel` funnel plot of genotype specific IV estimates
 - `mr` acts as a primary command, e.g. so the other commands can be run as `mr egger ...` as well 
 as `mregger ...`
 - `mrmvivw` (`mvmr`, `mvivw`) implements the multivariable IVW model
 - `mrmvegger` implements the multivariable MR-Egger model
 - `mrleaveoneout` implements leave one (genotype) out analysis

## Installing and updating mrrobust
To install mrrobust in Stata versions 13 and later you have two choices.

### 1. Use `net install`

``` stata
net install mrrobust, from("https://raw.github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust/master/") replace
mrdeps
```
In this code `mrdeps` installs the dependencies. These are `addplot`, `kdens`, and `moremata` 
packages (all by Ben Jann), the `heterogi` command (Orsini et al.), the `metan` command (Harris et 
al.), and the `grc1leg` command (Wiggins).

If you have previously installed the package and the `net install` command above fails with an error
 message that there are two copies of the package installed simply run `adoupdate`.

To check if there is an update available to any of your user-written Stata packages run `adoupdate`.
 To update mrrobust run:
``` stata
adoupdate mrrobust, update
```

To uninstall mrrobust, issue in Stata:
``` stata
ado uninstall mrrobust
```
If this fails with an error message mentioning that you have "multiple citations/instances of the 
package installed" simply issue `adoupdate mrrobust` which should leave you with the most recent 
version of the package you previously installed. You can then run `ado uninstall mrrobust`.

### 2. Use the `github` package

``` stata
net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
gitget mrrobust
```
This automatically installs the dependencies.

To update the package issue:
``` stata
github update mrrobust
```

To uninstall mrrobust issue:
``` stata
github uninstall mrrobust
```

### Installation for Stata version 12 and earlier versions
The `net install` syntax for installing `mrrobust` does not work under Stata version 12 and earlier 
because this webpage has an address starting with https rather than http. In such cases you need to 
do a manual installation.

#### To download and install mrrobust manually:

* click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of the GitHub repository 
[here](https://github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust) and download as a zip archive.
* On your computer, extract the zip archive and move the extracted files to your `adopath` 
* Typing `adopath` in Stata shows you the folders where the Stata programs, ado-files, are saved. 
Save the mrrobust files in the folder marked `PERSONAL`. If the folder Stata is pointing to does 
not exist simply make it, e.g. using Windows Explorer.

The installation commands for the other dependencies should work. However, if you want to install 
them manually: 

 * the `moremata` package is available as a zip file 
 [here](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/m/moremata.zip)
 * the `addplot` package is available [here](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/a/addplot.zip) 
 * the `heterogi` command is available [here](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s449201.html)
 * the `kdens` package is available [here](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/k/kdens.zip)
 * the `metan` command is available [here](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s456798.html)
 * `grc1leg` can be installed in Stata with
    ``` stata
    net install grc1leg, from("https://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins")
    ```
 
Extract the zip archives and save all files on your `adopath`.

To uninstall a manual installation simply delete the files that you placed on your adopath.

## Code testing
As far as I know, and unlike R which has the `testthat` package, there is no recognised standard 
for writing unit tests for Stata commands. However, StataCorp refer to such do-files as cscripts 
(certification scripts). If you are interested I publish my cscripts (and their log files of output)
 in the [cscripts directory](https://github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust/tree/master/cscripts) in the 
 GitHub repository.
